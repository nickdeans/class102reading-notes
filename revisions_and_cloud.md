# Revisions and the Cloud

## Version Control 
Version Control is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes. Through version control, one can revert a file or project to a previous version, track modifications and modifying individuals, and compare changes. By utilizing a Version Control System (VCS), mistakes with files can easily be rectified.

### Three types of Version Control 
1.Local Version Control
- A Local VCS entails one database on your hard disk that stores changes to files.

1.Centralized Version Control
- This system entails a single server storing all changes and file versions, which can be accessed by various clients. 

1.Distributed Version Control
- DVCS allows clients to create mirrored repositories. These data backups can be easily be placed on the server to replace any lost information.

## What Is Git?
**Git** is a type of **Version Control**, or DVCS to be exact, that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots.
